# FizzBuzz and Palindrome Challenges

This repository contains solutions for two programming challenges: FizzBuzz and Palindrome.

## FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz challenge involves printing numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

### Usage

To run the FizzBuzz program, execute the following command:

```shell
go run fizzbuzz.go
```

## Palindrome
The Palindrome challenge involves checking whether a given string is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces and letter casing.

### Usage
To run the Palindrome program, execute the following command:

```shell
go run palindrome.go
```
